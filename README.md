The folder structure is identical to the original posted to github, as I copied it directly off of there. The scripts and Excel files I've been working with are under the sub-folder Vansjo Application. NJM_modelVAN_v12 is nearly identical to RMC_modelVAN_v12, and NJM_MyLake is the script I've started from scratch. Both NJM scripts run the model with the same results, though NJM_modelVAN_v12 produces 22 plots. The Excel files beginning with LA contain the data for Auburn Lake in Maine, but the scripts are currently set to read the NJM Excel files. This is because the scripts will not run using the LA files, presumably because the data is incomplete and it will not run without certain inputs/parameters that those files are missing. So, the NJM Excel files contain the complete data from the LA files, and are supplemented with just enough data from the original Vansjo input files to let the model run.
